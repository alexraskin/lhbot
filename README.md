## Why did I make LhBot?

If you follow LhCloudy on twitch, you will know, that he will not share what Lh stands for in his name. I decided to write a discord bot, that keeps track of everyone's guesses in his discord, plus a bunch of other fun things. It is mainly used in his discord server, but you can also use it in your own server. Please create an issue if you have any questions.

## Deploy

A few things you will need:

- Discord bot
- Mongo database (I use atlas)
- A Railway account

Take a look in the [`/example-files`](https://github.com/alexraskin/lhbot/tree/main/example-files) folder for examples of the files you will need to create.

## Run the bot locally

To run the bot locally, you will need to fill in the `.env` file all the values that are missing.

```bash
make run
```
